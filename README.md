# Javascript-assessment-Find Your Hat

What did you like about this project?

By learning and completing this project, I began to notice the charm of Javascript. 
When you become proficient with various classes, functions, and methods, you can create any functionality you need and like. 
I didn't even imagine making small games through javascript at all.


What did you struggle with in this project?


When I just learned about the conditions required by this project, I couldn't give all the requirements solutions quickly, so I spent some time checking what are the functions and methods apply here. When the codes that can be used are determined, it is found that the codes cannot be closely linked and mobilized, just like the scattered parts of a machine. 
But it is gratifying that the project was finally completed by searching solution from Google. The overall feeling is that it takes a lot of practice to really master javascript and be able to solve problems proficiently.


What would make your experience with this assessment better?

JavaScript is a very flexible language. It takes a lot of practice to master it. If time permits, I do at least one practice a day. Constantly improve the logic and proficiency of it.
